## 🌟 Key Features

### Transfer Recommendations

Get **5 players per position** ranked by a heuristic score:

```
Score = (Form × 0.25) + (Value × 0.20) + (Contrarian × 0.15) 
        + (Fixtures × 0.25) + (Playing Time × 0.15)
```

**What you see:**
- Player name, team, price
- Recent form (0-10)
- Ownership % (contrarian edge)
- Expected points & fixture difficulty
- Heuristic score & reasoning (not a full transfer optimizer)

### Differentials

Find **5 high-upside players** with:
- Very low ownership (<15%)
- Good recent form
- Easy upcoming fixtures
- High potential for rank gains

**Perfect for:**
- Mini-league competition
- Gaining rank advantage
- When behind on points

## 💡 Understanding Scores

### Transfer Recommendation Score
```
7.0+ = Excellent recommendation
5.0-7.0 = Good option
3.0-5.0 = Consider if needed
```

**Why these factors?**
- **Form (25%)** - Recent performance matters most
- **Value (20%)** - Get points per pound spent
- **Contrarian (15%)** - Unique edge in mini-leagues
- **Fixtures (25%)** - Easy games = more points
- **Playing Time (15%)** - Must get minutes

### Differential Score
- Low ownership (40% weight)
- Good form (35% weight)
- Easy fixtures (25% weight)

## 🎯 Pro Tips

### Using Transfer Recommendations
1. Check **highest scores first** in each position
2. Verify you have enough **transfer bank** (£m shown)
3. Consider **position depth** - don't overload one position
4. Mix **safety** (high-scoring popular) with **risk** (differentials)

### Using Differentials
1. Compare with **mini-league opponent teams**
2. Look for **very low ownership** (<5%)
3. Balance **core team** (70%) with **differentials** (30%)
4. Use when **behind** for maximum impact

### When to Transfer
- Use free transfer on weakest position
- Wildcard when 3+ underperformers
- Free Hit for unexpected emergencies
- Plan chips 2-3 weeks ahead
